          <p>Felixstowe Chess club meets on Tuesday evenings at the The Dooley pub, normally from 7pm until around 10pm during the chess playing season from September to April. We play friendly chess and hold club tournaments from time to time. We currently have three teams entered in to the Suffolk Chess League.</p>
          <p>The club plays rapidplay and standard / fischer timing matches and the season runs from about October to April the following year. All new members are welcome regardless of their playing strength.</p>
          <p>We expect only two things:  A love of the game and a willingness to learn.</p>
